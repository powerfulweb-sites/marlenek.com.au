## What is BBGlow

BBGlow is a Korean skincare procedure.

The ingredients in the booster serum are worked into the skin via a painless method. These ingredients will encourage hydration, regeneration and collagen production, it is designed to leave your skin glowing and fresh. The bbglow pigment just like a bbglow cream is also worked into the skin . This helps minimise and improve the look of dark spots , open pores, helps to even out skin tones,and generally brightens the skin . The bbglow treatment uses serums made with all natural ingredients to improve the look and feel of your skin fast, with visible improvements seen between 4 to 6 weeks .

Skin will continue to regenerate after the bbglow treatment is done due to the ingredients in the serum.

## How many treatments will I need?

You can have one treatment for that glow and deep deep facial treatment. However if you are looking at achieving colour tint in the skin you will need 4 to 5 treatments every 2 weeks.
