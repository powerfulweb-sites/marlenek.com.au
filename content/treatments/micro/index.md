Deep facial cleanse that makes way for fresh new skin cells

For youthful, glowing skin our microdermabrasion treatment uses sterile diamond heads to remove unwanted dead skin to make way for the new skin cells. Microdermabrasion also helps stimulate collagen and elastin for a smoother layer of skin.

All skin is exposed to the environmental elements every day. Over the years your skin can become damaged due to pollution, sun damage and other environmental factors.

Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure the removed top layer skin cells to reveal younger looking skin. Microdermabrasion also promotes collagen production. Microdermabrasion differs from dermabrasion as it is not as intensive. If you suffer from facial lines, age spots, sun damage, pigmentation, clogged pores, acne scars, then microdermabrasion may assist. Note that microdermabrasion will not remove deep scars or deep facial lines.
