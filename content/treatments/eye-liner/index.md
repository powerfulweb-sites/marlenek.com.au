Eyeliner tattoo is a permanent eyeliner that is used as a treatment that replaces the need to wear eyeliner each day. It can  last 3-10 years however, the colour retention varies according to individual skin type. Factors affecting duration include skin type (thicker skin fades faster), life style (sun exposure) body chemistry, and age. Great solution for people that are vision impaired, allergies, active life styles, smudging or just time saving.
