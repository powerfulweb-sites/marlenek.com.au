## What is Fibro Blast Plasmawave ?

The Plasmawave plasma device creates genuine plasma output not an electrical current. This plasma arc permits precise ‘soft surgery’ such as skin tag and mole removal as well as effective non-surgical blepharoplasty (eye lid correction) and other treatments using sublimation, fulguration and electrocoagulation.

## Plasma Tip

The Plasma Wave machine conductor tip creates a tiny plasma flash from the tip (similar to a tiny lightening bolt). The tip does not need to touch the skin. The plasma lightning jumps from the tip to the skin and evaporates, leaving a very small superficial brown carbon spots that look like freckles. There is no heat to the surrounding skin.  These small spots draw the skin together in their direct environment and shrink the excess skin. We follow a specific pattern to set the points to look like a grid (a reduction grid). This is a non-surgical, non-invasive treatment that shrinks excess skin, bags and wrinkles! This treatment protocol is also used for other areas of the face/body.

## Principle

The principle is to ionise gases in the air to create a small electrical arc, similar to a tiny lightning bolt, with which the areas affected by aesthetic problems may be treated, without unwanted damage to surrounding areas.

The plasma causes instant contraction and tightening of skin fibers causing shortening and tightening of skin fibers, thus resulting in the reduction of the skin surface.
